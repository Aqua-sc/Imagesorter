    <p>This website was made with the goal of easing the process of sorting a bunch of (e.g. holiday-)pictures</p>
    <p>It is your device that processes the data, nothing is sent to any server!</p>
    <p>Make sure to check the <a href="{base}/instructions"><u>instructions</u></a> page to get an idea of what is possible</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any bugs or suggestions can be communicated to me using <a href="https://github.com/Aqua-sc/PictureSorter/issues/new"><u>a Github issue</u></a></p>
